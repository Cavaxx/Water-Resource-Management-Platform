    "The use of color palettes has 5 different goals: Differentiation among visual elements, Highlighting some elements, Encoding Data Values, Creating Visual Hierarchy, Improving Aesthetics. The Differentiation is required to distinguish different data series or categories. Let's think to a pie chart with different slices. Each slice has a different color respect to the others in order to differentiate itself, and the data represented by it, from the others slice. Highlinghting has a more persuasive role, indeed we want to highlight some parts of a graph to draw attention on them in to promote a specific intrepretation of those data. On the other hand, Encoding Data Values has a mere gnoseologic aim. By using,for instance an heat map, we want to represent data values or ranges through color gradients. Creating Visual Hierarchy is the way to make clear and selfevident what are the most important infos showed on a graph. As example we can take a bar chart with different sections of bars colored to indicate primary and secondary data points. Least but for importance, Improving Aesthetics plays a crucial role into pleasing the viewers and bring their attention to our works.So the improvement of the aesthetics can be define an the enhancing of the visual appeal to make the visualization more engaging. \n"

    "UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are both widely used for non-linear dimensionality reduction, but they differ in their approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "UMAP is a topology-based dimensionality reduction algorithm. This means it focuses on preserving the topological structure of the data. In this context, \"manifold\" refers to a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space, allowing the data to be understood as lying on some continuous surface. UMAP aims to maintain both local and global structures of the data when reducing its dimensionality. It works by constructing a high-dimensional graph representation of the data and then optimizing a low-dimensional graph to be as structurally similar as possible to the high-dimensional one. This approach helps in retaining the overall shape and connectivity patterns of the data, making UMAP particularly effective at preserving the continuity and relationships in the data's underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, t-SNE relies on statistical methods for dimensionality reduction. The algorithm converts pairwise similarities between data points into joint probabilities and seeks to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these probabilities in high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces. Essentially, t-SNE aims to preserve the local relationships between data points. It excels at revealing clusters within the data by ensuring that points that are close in the high-dimensional space remain close in the low-dimensional space, while points that are far apart in the high-dimensional space are also far apart in the low-dimensional space. This focus on local neighborhood preservation makes t-SNE particularly effective at identifying and visualizing distinct groupings within the data."
